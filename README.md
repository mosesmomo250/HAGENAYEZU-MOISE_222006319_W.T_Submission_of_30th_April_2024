Documentation That explaining the project structure, functionality, and usage for online voting system project which will allow users to vote using online;
The Online Voting System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the process of voting through an online platform. It allows registered users to participate in various elections by casting their votes securely and conveniently from anywhere with internet access.

Project Structure
The project follows a typical web application structure, comprising frontend and backend components:

Frontend:
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Responsible for the user interface and interactivity.
Frameworks/Libraries: May include frontend frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js for building dynamic UI components.
Backend:
Server: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
Database: Stores user data, candidate information, and voting records.
Business Logic: Implements the core functionality of user authentication, vote casting, and result tabulation.
APIs: Provide endpoints for frontend communication and data manipulation.
Database Schema:
Defines the structure of the database tables, including entities such as Users, Candidates, Elections, and Votes.
Ensures data integrity and facilitates efficient querying.
Functionality
User Authentication:
Users can register for an account by providing necessary details.
Registered users can log in securely using their credentials.
Password hashing and salting are employed for enhanced security.
Voting Process:
Users can view available elections and candidate lists.
Each user is allowed to cast a single vote in each election.
Once a vote is cast, it is recorded securely in the database.
Election Management:
Administrators can create new elections, specifying details such as the title, duration, and eligible candidates.
They can also view and manage existing elections, including starting, stopping, or deleting them as needed.
Result Tabulation:
Once an election concludes, the system calculates and displays the results.
Results may be presented in various formats, such as bar charts or tables, for easy interpretation.
Usage
User Perspective:
Registration:
Navigate to the registration page.
Fill in the required information.
Submit the registration form.
Login:
Access the login page.
Enter username and password.
Click the login button.
Voting:
Browse available elections.
Select desired candidates.
Submit the vote.
Administrator Perspective:
Authentication:
Log in using administrator credentials.
Election Management:
Create new elections or manage existing ones.
Monitor voting progress and results.
Deployment
1. Infrastructure Setup:
Choose Hosting Provider: Select a hosting provider such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, or a managed hosting service like Heroku.
Provision Servers or Containers: Set up virtual machines (VMs) or containers to host the frontend, backend, and database components of the application.
Configure Networking: Set up networking rules, firewall rules, and domain name configuration to ensure proper communication between the components and external access to the application.
2. Environment Setup:
Install Dependencies: Install necessary software dependencies such as Node.js, Python, database management systems, and any other required libraries or frameworks on the server/container instances.
Configure Environment Variables: Set environment variables for storing sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and application configuration settings. Use environment-specific configuration files or a configuration management tool like dotenv.
3. Database Setup:
Create Database: Set up the database instance on the server/container and initialize it with the necessary schema and initial data.
Configure Database Connection: Update the application configuration to point to the database instance using the appropriate connection string or configuration parameters.
4. Deployment Process:
Build the Application: Compile frontend assets and bundle backend code into executable files.
Package Application: Package the application into deployable artifacts such as Docker images, ZIP files, or deployment packages.
Deploy Application:
For Dockerized Applications:
Build Docker images for each component (frontend, backend, database) using Dockerfiles.
Push Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
Deploy containers using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
For Non-Dockerized Applications:
Copy application files to the server/container instances.
Install dependencies and configure the application as needed.
Start the application services (frontend server, backend server, database server).
5. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
Set up triggers to automatically deploy changes to the production environment when new code is pushed to the repository or after passing automated tests.
6. Monitoring and Maintenance:
Set up monitoring and logging tools to monitor application performance, track errors, and analyze system metrics.
Implement alerting mechanisms to notify administrators of any critical issues or anomalies.
Regularly perform maintenance tasks such as applying security patches, updating dependencies, and optimizing performance.
7. Security Considerations:
Configure SSL/TLS encryption to secure communication between clients and servers.
Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to sensitive resources and endpoints.
Regularly audit and review the application codebase for security vulnerabilities, and apply security best practices to mitigate potential risks.

Conclusion
The Online Voting System provides a user-friendly and secure platform for conducting elections online. With its intuitive interface and robust features, it streamlines the voting process while ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the election results.
